# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- The Tools menu entry is translated again. `main.lua` took `_` from
  KOReader's `gettext`, which knows nothing of this plugin's strings, so the
  menu label stayed English while the game's own screen, which goes through
  `i18n`, was translated. `_` now comes from `i18n` here too.


## [1.2.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- Picks up game-common v1.5.0. Play statistics were recorded under a key no
  tool could match: `ReaderUI`/`FileManager:registerModule()` rewrite a plugin
  instance's `name` to `reader<id>` / `filemanager<id>` right after it is
  built, so this game's sessions were split across two rows and neither
  carried its plugin id. Rows written under the old keys are merged back on
  first read. The same release brings the `stopPlugin()` /
  `deletePluginSettings()` hooks KOReader 2026.07 calls when a plugin is
  deleted from the device (PR #15240).

  No change to this plugin's own code -- it inherits all of it from the
  shared library.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Hint** button. Two taps, not one: the first says which cell is about to
  give, the second acts on it -- a player who is told where to look usually
  finds the rest themselves, and only pays for the full reveal if they want
  it. A cell that contradicts the solution is always reported before a fresh
  one is revealed, and on a mistake the hint empties the cell rather than
  solving it.

## [1.1.16] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- `board_widget.lua` referenced Blitbuffer color constants that don't
  exist (COLOR_GRAY_C), which evaluated to `nil` and crashed the
  color-comparison in `paintTo()` as soon as the corresponding
  highlight was drawn. Now uses the correct constant name(s)
  (COLOR_LIGHT_GRAY).

## [1.1.12] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- Generated puzzles had no uniqueness verification at all — measured as
  0% unique at Easy/Medium across every grid size, and only ~13% unique
  even at Hard. Added a uniqueness solver (with proper wall-forcing and
  illumination-forcing constraint propagation) and reworked generation
  to escalate how many black cells reveal their wall number before
  accepting a puzzle. 7×7 and 10×10 puzzles are now unique far more
  reliably; 14×14 is a documented partial improvement (see README).
